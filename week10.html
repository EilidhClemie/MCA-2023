<h1>Week 10: Audio Similarity and Transcription</h1>
  
<p>For the pruposes of this task I utilised the same three tracks from my work on extracting and analysing audio files to replace tracks 7, 8, and 9 within the similarity matrix.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Let It Be: This track, orginally released in 1970, could be classified across the genres of rock, soft rock, and pop, with the ballad being led by Paul McCartney's voice and piano compositions. As the song progresses, accompanying voice and instrumentation such as softer guitar and a low orchestral section are incorporated.
	</li>
	<li>Help!: This track, originally released in 1965, could be classified as a rock song, with the song being comparitvely higher energy to the other two incorporated tracks by The Beatles. The song's distinctive high energy is led by the layer vocals led by John Lennon, the distinctive guitar riff, and Ringo Starr's drums/percussion instrumentation.
	</li>
	<li>Come Together: This track, originally released in 1969, could be classified as rock, but has also been labelled as blues rock and swamp rock. These labels are earned by its distinctive opening of low drums, bass, and rhythm guitar, which is progressed by the Lennons vocals and accompanied by greater instrumentation of guitar, backing vocals, and electric piano.
	</li>
<p>The tracks while all broadly incoporated under a 'rock' label, do differ stylistically, coming from different periods within The Beatles' catalogue.</p>
<p>Below is a visualisation of similarity between the provided classical and rock tracks as well as the three tracks from the previous week's work:</p>

<p>For this next task, I utilised the edited section of my Musescore file of The Beatles' Let It Be. Below is an image of the Musescore visualisation of the Transcription of Let It Be:</p>

<p>When comparing the polyphonic transcription and the original notation, it is clear that there are a lot of weaknesses. Firstly, the detected tempo, distribution of the measures, and the time signature are incorrect. Sonically, the elements of the piece melody are recognisable, as well as some of the notes. However, visually, the piece has been transcribed to something drastically overcomplicated and musically incorrect, losing the any great clarity of the original piece. Consistently throughout there are incorrect, additional, or ommitted notes, as well as a large amount of accent and editorial markings have been incorporated.</p>
