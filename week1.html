<h1>Week 1: Basics of Music Data</h1>

	<div class="headings">Identified Theme</div>
		<p>The central theme of my dataset is the music of The Beatles. The Beatles can be categorised as an popular English rock band which hold a large musical and cultural significance. The core contributing performers include John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Their catalogue primarily was produced and released within between the years of 1960 to 1970. The core of their discography is their 12 studio albums, although other manifestations of their music have been released through singles, EPs, compilations, and live albums.</p>

	<div class="headings">Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)?</div>
		<p>The diversity of the manifestations of musical data, such notated and audio data, can span across analogue and digital forms meaning the challenges for collection, preservation, curation, and accessibility of music data are complex and have undergone drastic shifts with wider changes in music manifestations and industry practices around music data. In regard to what I would describe as the key issues, cooperation, standardisation, and interoperability are challenges when managing and creating value with music data, especially with digital spheres. Furthermore, the development and investment, or lack of, within various music related technologies will be extremely pertinent. Building on this, access to music data and music-related data is heavily governed by ownership and licensing rights.Lastly, better governance across the music sector in related to data standards is required in order to relieve many issues, such as metadata omission or inconsistencyAll of these issues become especially relevant if aiming to analyse, or create meaningful applications of musical data sets.</p>
	<div class="headings">How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed</div>
		<p>In relation to my dataset, the musical data of The Beatles illustrates many of these issues within a context of popular modern music. The Beatles, as a modern commercialised label, especially articulate the complicated issue of ownership and licensing. Through the time since the intital releases of their core discography, ownership has shifted at many points. Currently, the rights to their music are known to be divided between Paul McCartney and Sony Music Publishing, meaning rights to much of their sheet music and recordings are strictly held until released in public domain. Current manifestations of their music are therefore held and distributed across analogue and digital platforms under the title of the band. Recording and performances are easily accessible via these mediums, however, their notated music is harder to aquire. Much of their catalogue has been published through various collections, as well as some being unofficialy distributed online through websites dedicated to notated music (although this is often for a fee). Therefore, in therms of their musical data as a wider set, much of its presentation, description and analysis are governed by the platforms and mediums in which they distrubute, whether this be large music platforms such as Spotfiy, YouTube, and Apple Music, or within archives.</p>
