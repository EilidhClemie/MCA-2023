  <h1> Week 2: Notated Music </h1>
  <p> In order to explore music notation and the data behind it I have utilised the software of Musescore to transcribe a notated score of The Beatle's 1970 song 'Let It Be'. </p>
  <p> Below is an image of a section of the score which was transcribed and subsequently corrected. The full piece incompletely edited pieced is available here. </p>
