<h1>Week 9: Analysing and Extracting Information from Audio</h1>
  
<p>Below I have extracted spectrograms, Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients, and Chromagrams from the same three tracks which were utilised within my previous week's work.</p>

<p>Below is the visualisations of chroma histograms for each of the tracks:</p>

<div class="headings">Let It Be</div>

</div>

<div class="headings">Help!</div>
<div class="ChromaGraph">
<img src="./data/HELP!_CHROMA.png" alt="HELP!_CHROMA">
</div>

<div class="headings">Come Together</div>
<div class="ChromaGraph">
<img src="./data/LIB_CHROMA.png" alt="LIB_CHROMA">
</div>

<p>From analysing the histograms for the chromagrams of each track, a few of the following observations can be made. Chromagrams communicate the strength of pitches higher and lower pitches within the song across the pitch classes. From the histograms it is evident that Let It Be has a higher predominance of pitches within the lower end of the pitch classes, with this frequency at times spreading over a broader amount of pitches. Where as the pitches within Help! while of less intensity, are often spread more evenly across a narrower range. Come Together has a stronger amount of lower frequencies, with a less broad range.If accurate, these analyses correlate with the over all intensity of higher and lower sounds/instrumentation, i.e., Come Together incoporates more isolated lower sounding instruments and notes comapred to Help!'s more intense instrumentation which overlaps and mixes instruments and notes across higher and lower frequencies.
