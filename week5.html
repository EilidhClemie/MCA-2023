<p>As a group, our pieces were all relatively modern, so much of our metadata shared of relevancy. Below is a schema for the elements from our selection which were most relevant for my piece, and subsequently encoded into my own MEI file for The Beatlesâ€™ Let It Be.</p>
<p>A copy of my MEI file with the implemented metadata can be downloaded <a href="./data//Update MEI.mei" download target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
