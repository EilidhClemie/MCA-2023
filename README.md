### Task 2
The central theme within my dataset is the music of The Beatles. The Beatles can be categorised as an English popular rock band which hold a large musical and cultural significance. The core contributing performers include John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Their catalogue primarily was produced and released within between the years of 1960 to 1970. The core of their discography is their 12 studio albums, although other manifestations of their music have been released through singles, EPs, compilations, and live albums.
### Task 3
*Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.

The diversity of the manifestations of musical data, such notated and audio data, can span across analogue and digital forms meaning the challenges for collection, preservation, curation, and accessibility of music data spans across physical and digital spaces. Building on this, access to music data and music-related data is heavily governed by ownership and licensing rights. Cooperation, standardisation, and interoperability are challenges when managing and creating value with music data, especially with digital spheres. This becomes especially pertinent if aiming to analyse, or create meaningful applications of musical data sets through machines. Lastly, better governance across the music sector in related to data standards is required in order to relieve many issues.

In relation to my dataset, the musical data of The Beatles
