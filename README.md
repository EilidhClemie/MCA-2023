## Week 1
### Task 2
Dataset Theme: Political and Historical Irish Music
### Task 3
*Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)?*

* Musical scores are often physical objects which need to be collected, preserved, and digitised in order for access, curation and distribution online. This comes with numerous challenges in terms of management of a historical or valuable object.
* The nature of musical scores means that an understanding of how that specific piece translates and is understood is often varied.
* Music data comes in a variety of mediums and iterations, each often original, especially when it comes to audio recordings.
   
*How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.*

* Around the theme of political and historical Irish music, the data is often made up of digitsed, historical objects of sheet music. This means that the sources had to be digitised in order for access, curation and distribution online. This can mean that only a select amound of objects are accessible.
* Due to the nature of the data being historical, much of music sheets are not accompanied by audio recordings.
* Much of the data is curateda around geographical locations, historical periods, or subject, such as Irish freedom.
* The data is often accompanied by contextual information around where it sits within a historical period rather than detail of its musical content.
