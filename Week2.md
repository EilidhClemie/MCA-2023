## Week 2
Within my wider theme of The Beatles, I chose to transcribe the notated score for the bands 1970 song, Let It Be within Musescore. Below I have attached an image of the first section of the score which was transcribed and subsequently corrected. Further, I the full transcribed score is available here.

Apparent from observations of the transcription is evidence of the capacities and weaknesses of OMR technology.
