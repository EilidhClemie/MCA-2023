<h1>Week 2: Notation Basics</h1>

	<p>Within my wider theme of The Beatles, I chose to transcribe the notated score for the bands 1970 song, Let It Be within Musescore. Below I have attached an image of the first section of the score which was transcribed and subsequently corrected.</p>
<p>A copy of my corrected MuseScore file (first ten bars corrected) can be downloaded <a href="./data/Fully Edited - Let It Be.mscz" download target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Below is a comparison of the first ten bars of Let It Be before and after editing:</p>
						<table>

		<div class="headings">Discuss the aspects of your score that were not transcribed properly by the OMR engine</div>

		<p>Through the process of transcription and correction of the score, evidenced were some of the capacities and weaknesses of OMR technology. As a group, we utilised Musescoreâ€™s software to transcribe various pieces composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart which demonstrated the challenges of machine recognition of notation, which is historical in nature, with Musescore producing very poor replications of the original composition. Comparative to this, my own transcription of relatively modern score, while improving, did still incorporate several of the same faults. This is evidenced in the attached full Musescore file. From playback of the music, the primary disruptor was its failure to implement the correct time signature, resulting in incorrect organisational patterns of the beats. Furthermore, the software was inconsistent in its recognition of notes, replicating certain bars very strongly, and some very poorly. Lastly, tempo, and, accents, editorial markings, and beams, on or between notes were often omitted, disrupting the overall sound replication of the piece.</p>
